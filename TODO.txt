= TODO List pwdStore

== Bugs to fix

== New Features
* Secrets print view
* Transferring secrets to other users
* Export to CSV/ODS, eventually PDF
* Backup in own binary file format (.pwdstore), restoreable and encryptable 
    Perhaps make backup un-encrypted if wanted (so it can be restored using 
    a completely different user)
* Registration page to be enabled by admins
* Delete categories including all secrets (instead of aborting)
