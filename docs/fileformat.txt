== Preamble
This file describes the binary 'pwdstore secrets file (.psf)' file format used 
to store one or more secrets and all their corresponding data in one file. The 
main goal is to enable the user to easily backup and re-import secrets data in 
a file format not easily readable with an ASCII text editor.

Each file comes with some header information (version of PWDSTORE, contained 
secret entries, encrypted yes/no ...) and a content section containing 
secrets.

== File header
The header of a 'pwdstore secrets file' mainly contains information about the 
system that created the file and about the file itself. All data is being 
written binary, ordered top to bottom:

.pwdstore secrets file header
[options="header"]
|====
| Field | Description | Length
| _DUMMY_ | A dummy field indicating a 'pwdstore secrets file', only contains the text "PWDSTORE" | 8 bytes
| Version | Version of the PWDSTORE instance that created the file | 8 bytes
| # secrets | Contains the count of secrets within the file | 3 bytes
| encrypted | Bool value telling if the secrets are encrypted or not | 1 byte
|====

== File content
The main part of the file contains information about secrets and the secret data 
itself. Again, each secret entry consists of a header and a body.

The header contains all fixed-size values for a secret plus indicators about 
how long the variable-sized text fields are for one particular entry. +
The body section contains the real text as binary encoded UTF-8 strings.

.secret header
[options="header"]
|====
| Field | Description | Length
| id | The secret's database id | 4 bytes
| user_id | The user this secret belongs to | 4 bytes
| category | The cateogry this secret belongs to | 4 bytes
| date | The date this secret was created/modified | 4 bytes
| tags_length | Length of field 'tags' in bytes | 4 bytes
| description_length | Length of field 'description' in bytes | 4 bytes
| secret_length | Length of field 'secret' in bytes | 4 bytes
| comment_length | Length of field 'comment' in bytes | 4 bytes
|====

NOTE: With this header, each and every secret entry (even if empty) has a size of 
at least *32 bytes*.

.secret body
[options="header"]
|====
| Field | Description | Length
| tags | The 'tags' value | L+1 bytes, L < 2^8
| description | The 'description' of the secret | L+2 bytes, L < 2^16
| secret | The real secret data, either encrypted or not | L+2 bytes, L < 2^16
| comment | Comment about the secret | L+2 bytes, L < 2^16
|====

NOTE: *L* means the actual length of the text in characters

NOTE: Each and every secret entry can have a maximum size of *196'903 bytes* or 
    about *192 kilobytes*.
